# AES Encryption in PrivVault
---

## What is AES?
- Advanced Encryption Standard
- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Industry standard for secure data storage
- We use AES-256-GCM variant
---

## Key Components in PrivVault
![AES Components](../images/aes-components.png)
- 256-bit Encryption Key
- 16-byte Initialization Vector (IV)
- 64-byte Salt
- 16-byte Authentication Tag
---

## How We Encrypt Your Data
![Encryption Flow](../images/encryption-flow.png)
1. User enters sensitive data
2. System generates random IV & Salt
3. Derives encryption key using master key
4. Encrypts data using AES-256-GCM
5. Stores encrypted data in database
---

## Real Example from PrivVault

```typescript
// Original password
const password = "MyPassword123"

// After encryption
const encrypted = "hK8Jm...base64...2nP="
```

---

## Encryption Process Visualization
```
Original: "MyPassword123"
â†“
Add Salt + IV: "random-salt" + "random-iv" + "MyPassword123"
â†“
Encrypt with AES: "hK8Jm...encrypted-data...2nP="
â†“
Store in Database
```
---

## Decryption Process
![Decryption Flow](../images/decryption-flow.png)
1. Retrieve encrypted data
2. Extract Salt, IV, and Tag
3. Derive same key using master key
4. Authenticate and decrypt
5. Return original data
---

## Security Features
- âœ… Protection against brute force attacks
- âœ… Unique encryption per item
- âœ… Data integrity verification
- âœ… Secure key derivation
---

## Implementation in PrivVault
```typescript
// Encrypting user data
const secureNote = encryptData(
  "My secret note",
  userMasterKey
);

// Decrypting when needed
const originalNote = decryptData(
  secureNote,
  userMasterKey
);
```

## Why This Matters
- ðŸ”’ Zero-knowledge encryption
- ðŸš« Even we can't read your data
- âš¡ Fast and secure
- ðŸ”‘ You control your keys
